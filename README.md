==========================

Welcome to [my new portfolio of illustrations, animations and interactive design](http://visualjournali.st). This site represents the latest incarnation of an evolving portfolio and understanding of web design. 

Each iteration has been a way to experiment with new technologies. 

My first site was an elaborate <a href='http://designasprocess.com/view/'>Flash-based virtual Viewmaster</a>. Since then I've created table-based HTML sites, abandonded tables for CSS, and  hosted a couple of WordPress sites.

My last site was built as a [Node Express web application](https://github.com/visualjournalist/portfolio-sheet) using a <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qbDmkc5CQ0I14NWclfB0W3AA2EbLObX3ZKXJ8dVc-3o/pubhtml'>Google Spreadsheet</a> to supply the data. 

### The new solution ###

My current approach is to host [the site](http://visualjournali.st) using Jekyll and GitHub pages. 

Jekyll provides a simple solution for baking out a static site. GitHub Pages allows for a simple and fast way to host the site.
