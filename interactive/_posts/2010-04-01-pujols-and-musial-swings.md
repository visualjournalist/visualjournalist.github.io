**We synchronized archival slow-motion footage of baseball legend Stan Musial's swing with MVP Albert Pujols's swing, from four different camera angles.**

Musial and Pujols are considered two of the greatest Cardinals players, but they had radically different swings, reflecting very different eras in baseball.

### RESPONSIBILITIES

I planned, designed and developed this side-by-side comparison of the two players.

Using the archival footage of Musial as reference, I worked with the Post-Dispatch photographer to determine which shots we wanted to try to recreate. The photographer mounted several remote cameras to the batting cage at the Cardinals' spring training facility in Jupiter, Florida.

We sought out experts to provide audio analysis of their swings.
