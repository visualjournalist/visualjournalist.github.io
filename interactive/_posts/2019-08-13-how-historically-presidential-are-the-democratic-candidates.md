**The 2020 Democratic candidates running for president have a range of experiences. This project reveals how their experiences stack up against each other as well as with U.S. presidents throughout history.**

The page features a grid of U.S. presidential portraits. As the user scrolls, the faces of past presidents sharing the experiences of the featured presidential candidates are highlighted. 

An interactive map shows where past presidents and current candidates lived.

### RESPONSIBILITIES

I designed, coded and helped plan the overall story. This page is part of a large Jekyll-based project I created, with profiles of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. I used those profiles as a database for the candidates. As candidates tossed their hat in the ring (or announed they were withdrawing), I was able to easily update the entire project.
