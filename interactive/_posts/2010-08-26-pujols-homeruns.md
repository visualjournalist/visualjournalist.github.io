Albert Pujols reached the 400 home run milestone by age 30. Only Stan Musial had more as a St. Louis Cardinal. Here's a look at Albert's regular-season career homers. Sort the home runs by season, stadium, team and batting conditions in this interactive Flash graphic.

### RESPONSIBILITIES

I designed and developed this graphic to enable users to explore Albert Pujols' 400 home runs. 

His home runs can be mapped and filtered based on the stadium and team when they were hit. They can also be filtered based on parameters to compare home runs against left-handed pitchers or during night games or when there was a full count. 

I also graphed his home runs over time and showed how the cost per home run increased dramatically from his rookie year ($5,405) to his 10th season ($429,293).
