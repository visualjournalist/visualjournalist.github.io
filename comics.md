BRIAN WILLIAMSON has used comics journalism to help tell the first-person stories of elephant poachers, the story of a woman who married an ISIS fighter, as well as weaving comic book vignettes into a traditional long form story about man caught up in an FBI sting. Heâ€™s also used comics to help provide simplified explanations for complex technologies.
