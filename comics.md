BRIAN WILLIAMSON has used comics journalism to weave comic book vignettes into a traditional long form story about man caught up in an FBI sting, as well as telling the first-person stories of elephant poachers and the story of a woman who married an ISIS fighter. Heâ€™s also used comics to provide simplified explanations for complex technologies.
