BRIAN WILLIAMSON uses comics journalism to visualize first-person stories and explain complex concepts. He's woven comic book vignettes into a traditional long form story about man caught up in an FBI sting. He's told first-person stories of elephant poachers. And he's illustrated the words of a woman who married an ISIS fighter in Syria.
