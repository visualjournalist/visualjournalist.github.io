BRIAN WILLIAMSON creates conceptual illustrations, portraits, infographics and comics. He's illustrated everything from abstract stories on the economy to practical how-to stories on exercise. His illustrations have been featured in newspapers around the country. He is equally comfortable working with dirty, real-world paint and the virtual equivalent.
