I create conceptual illustrations, portraits, infographics and comics. I've illustrated everything from abstract stories on the economy to practical how-to stories on exercise. My illustrations have been featured in newspapers around the country. I am equally comfortable working with dirty, real-world paint and the virtual equivalent.
