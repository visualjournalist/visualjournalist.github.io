**Painted a portrait of William Least Heat-Moon, the reclusive author of “Blue Highways”.**

Because the author is notoriously secretive, this magazine profile used interviews of friends, colleagues and former students to tell his story.

We only had a handful of poorly shot snapshots of Heat-Moon, so I decided to paint his portrait.

I also created a series of pencil sketches of his local hangouts for spot illustrations throughout the article.
