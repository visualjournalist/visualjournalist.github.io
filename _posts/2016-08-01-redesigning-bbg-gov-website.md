**I led a small team that was responsible for redesigning the Broadcasting Board of Governors' main .gov website, transforming it into a modern responsive website using the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/09/28/web-design-standards/).**

The [previous site](https://web.archive.org/web/20141006045947/http://www.bbg.gov/) was hard to update and difficult to navigate. It was plagued by duplicative, outdated and inconsistent content.

### RESPONSIBILITIES

I worked with the stakeholders to define site requirements and identify opportunities to improve the workflow for maintaining the site. I was responsible for designing the overall look and feel of the website as well as creating the main page templates. I developed the templates from the initial pencil wireframes, to coding the HTML markup, to styling the pages with SASS/CSS. I worked closely with a developer on front end and back end code. I helped promote overall site consistency in the coding and visual styles across the site.
