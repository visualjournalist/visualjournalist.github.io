### RESPONSIBILITIES

I spoke with the reporter on the phone to outline the process. I emailed him a quick sketch to see if I understood what he was describing. We discussed clarifications and made edits as needed. While he revised the text, I worked on creating the drawings and setting up the HTML and CSS. By the end of the night we had a simple graphic to accompany a longer story.
