**The front lines of climate change run through the rapidly warming Arctic. The changes taking place on this faraway, frozen island will be felt much closer to home. Meet the scientists looking for clues of what to expect from a warming world.**

There are scientists using ancient ice core samples to explain how past changes in global temperatures could predict future changes. There are researchers looking at the feedback loop created by warming temperatures and thawing permafrost. And there are scientists looking at how changing temperatures may change the dynamic between caribou and mosquitos.

### RESPONSIBILITIES

I created five original cover illustrations using collaged textures, and incorporated this style into a video and static graphics explaining ice core drilling. I designed and coded the overall project.
