**For the 24th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, our office worked with Radio Free Asia to create an interactive iBook combining first person accounts with original audio, video and graphics.**

### RESPONSIBILITIES

To promote the book I created a short documentary about the project and the people who created it. I started off by conducting a series of interviews with the journalists and producers. I edited the footage together with archival photos and videos, and added screenshots of the application.

The goal of the video was to explain the importance of sharing the story and using new platforms to help circumvent Chinese censorship efforts.

The video was also used in RFA's application to the Association of International Broadcasters' annual awards competition. The iBook received the top award for innovative production technology at the 2013 International Media Excellence Awards ceremony.
