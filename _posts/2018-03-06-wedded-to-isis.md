**["Wedded to ISIS"](https://projects.voanews.com/wedded-to-isis/) is the story of a Syrian woman who fled Raqqa—the militants’ de-facto capital—with her husband, a former ISIS fighter. She speaks from a refugee camp while her husband is in prison. As she speaks, she attempts to distance herself from ISIS, saying her husband quit the group before they surrendered.**

VOA foreign correspondent Heather Murdock and I translated the interview with the wife of a former ISIS fighter into a web comic.

### RESPONSIBILITIES

I helped script, design, illustrate and code the web comic. This was my first attempt at using The New York Times' Adobe Illustrator plugin [ai2html](http://ai2html.org/) for creating responsive web comics. It was significantly easier to create organic layouts than using CSS alone.
