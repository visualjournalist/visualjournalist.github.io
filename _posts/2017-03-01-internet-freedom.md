**The internet crackles with potential. But in many countries, online freedoms are stifled by state censorship, surveillance, disinformation and economic inequality. This collection brings together reports from China, Russia, Cuba, Somalia and the Middle East, showing how the struggle for internet freedom plays out in the lives of ordinary citizens.**

This project explores internet freedom and how its availability, or restrictions, affect individuals. Itâ€™s a joint initiative by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Voice of America, Radio Free Asia and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting.

### RESPONSIBILITIES

Designed and developed overall site, as well as individual stories, graphics and illustrations. Worked closely with the reporters and editors for VOA's series of stories about Somalia's young digital explorers.
