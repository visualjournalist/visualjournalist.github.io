**Wrote, illustrated and animated a short video comparing how far professional athletes run in different sports. Spoiler alert: Baseball players are lazy; soccer players are amazing. Produced in French and English for Voice of America's 2014 World Cup coverage.**

The script:

Pro athletes are in amazing physical shape. But how far do they run in different sports?

Nobody tracks how far baseball players run. But even if Albert Pujols manages to round the bases four times, heâ€™s still running less than half a kilometer.

And recent technology tracking basketball players proves that even Luol Deng is running less than five kilometers.

But football players keep running. During a 90-minute match, some players have been tracked running over 15 kilometers. And players may spend 37% of that time sprinting.
