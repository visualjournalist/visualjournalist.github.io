**Helped create scripts and <a href='http://184.73.203.85:8080/storyboard.html'>storyboards</a> for short animations based on oral interviews with survivors of human trafficking. The animations were intended to help promote a series of longer documentaries about the survivors.**

### RESPONSIBILITIES

We selected excerpts from the interviews and edited them together to create the voice over narration for the videos. We then commissioned Cambodian artist <a href='http://www.npr.org/2012/06/19/155045295/confined-to-a-thai-fishing-boat-for-three-years'>Prum Vannak</a>, an artist and survivor of forced labor on a Thai fishing boat, to create the drawings for the animations. 

I made a simple tool for creating, editing and sharing <a href='https://github.com/bbgvisualjournalist/storyboard'>storyboards</a> with a team spread across the federal government, Radio Free Asia, the documentary crew in Cambodia and Vannak.
