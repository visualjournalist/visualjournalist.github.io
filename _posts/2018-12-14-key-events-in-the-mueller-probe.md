**Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation has turned up extensive evidence of Russian meddling during the 2016 election. Explore the indictments and possible connections between Trump associates and Russian interference.**

The project features a filterable [timeline](https://projects.voanews.com/russia-investigation/timeline.html) of key events, an overview of the people and organizations that have been [indicted](https://projects.voanews.com/russia-investigation/indictments.html) by Mueller, and a [history](https://projects.voanews.com/russia-investigation/history.html) of past special prosecution investigation.

### RESPONSIBILITIES ###

I designed and coded the site. I created the indictment diagram using [ai2html](http://ai2html.org), designing a  vertical version for mobile browsers and a horizontal version for larger screens. I set up a faux api for highlighting the names of key Mueller investigation figures found in VOA stories and displaying bios based on this project.
