**During the 1950s, Danish scientist Willi Dansgaard discovered that rain carries a record of the temperature at which it fell. Dansgaard realized he could read temperatures deep into the past by studying the chemical makeup of ice core samples.**

This video introduces Dansgaard, Camp Century in Greenland, and the science behind studying ice core samples.

### RESPONSIBILITIES
