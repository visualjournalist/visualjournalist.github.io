**Usability testing is a structured interview technique that can help evaluate and inform the development of a digital product. It gives direct insight into how real users actually navigate the digital interface.**

As our office transitioned to an agile development environment, the UX team ran a series of smaller, more frequent tests with five or six participants, taking time out for corrections in between each round of testing.

### RESPONSIBILITIES

I recorded notes during the initial tests, as well as leading some of the interviews. After the study was completed, I produced a short video to explain the value of the tests to various stakeholders.
