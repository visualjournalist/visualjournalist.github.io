**Created a two minute animation highlighting the challenges of online marketing and introducing BloomReach as the service to solve those problems.**

I oversaw the project from start to finish. I spent three days on site with the client, to understand their offering and help create the script. I also helped storyboard the final script, produce visual assets and animate the video.
