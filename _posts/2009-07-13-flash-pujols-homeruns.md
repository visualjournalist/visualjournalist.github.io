**The 2009 All-Star Game was held in St. Louis. The Home Run Derby project tracks the home runs during the three round competition.**

### RESPONSIBILITIES

I built the home run tracker in advance of the competition. It uses the angle of the ballâ€™s trajectory and the official distance to plot the position of the balls on the stadium diagram. On the night of the game, I entered the locations and distances of the home runs into a spreadsheet. I posted the finished project that night.
