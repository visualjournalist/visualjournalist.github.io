I started as a newspaper page designer at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, designing everything from the front page to business and feature pages. I now apply my experience in content driven design to online stories and features. I am comfortable working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, JSON and creating data visualizations with D3 and Leaflet.
